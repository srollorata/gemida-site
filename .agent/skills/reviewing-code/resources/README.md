Reviewing Code — resources

- `scripts/run-checks.sh`: run from repo root to collect lint/test/build results.
- `examples/pr-review-checklist.md`: copy this into PR comments or reviewer notes.

Notes:
- The validator at `.agent/skills/creating-antigravity-skills/scripts/validate-skill.js` can be used to check SKILL.md frontmatter rules.
- Keep `SKILL.md` concise and focused; prefer linking to example files for longer content.
